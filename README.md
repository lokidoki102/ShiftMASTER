# ShiftMASTER Orbital 2022/2023

**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Gemini

**Motivation:** <br>
Our team aims to provide a solution that targets shift work companies, particularly startups with limited employees, who struggle to manage their shift schedules. The proposed system eliminates the need for outdated and error-prone Excel sheets while providing an effective and affordable tool for both managers and employees.

**Aim:** <br>
Our shift management system aims to simplify the process of creating and managing shift schedules. Managers can easily assign shifts, manage time-off requests, and make adjustments on the fly, while workers can suggest their preferred timings and view their shifts efficiently.

**User Stories:** 
1. As a shift manager, I want to create shift schedules that accommodate everyone's preferences easily.
2. As a shift manager, I want to create and manage employee accounts and store inactive profiles in an archive.
3. As an employee, I want to suggest my preferred working timings/slots easily.
4. As an employee, I want to view my shifts easily.

**Key Features:**
1. Shift Overview
2. Overview of Employee Details
3. Access Control
   - Manage Shift Schedules (Employees & Manager)
   - Manage Employees' Accounts (Manager)

**Tech Stack:**
1. Firebase (Database & Deploying)
2. HTML, CSS (Frontend)
3. React.js (Backend)
4. Node.js (Backend)
